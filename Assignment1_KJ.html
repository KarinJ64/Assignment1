	<h2> Biography </h2>
	<h3> Education </h3>
	
	<p>
	I have a master of science in Electrical Engineering from KTH with a specialization in radio and telecoms. 
	Note that this was before mobile telephony and cellular networks were widely spread, so our focus was mainly on fixed telephony and fixed radio.
	</p>
	
	<h3> Personal life </h3>
	<p> 
	I am married with and have two children.
	My daughter, aged 30, is a linguist, having studied computer linguistics and nordic languages (Danish, Icelandic) at Uppsala University. 
	My son, aged 28, has a masters degree in information technology from Uppsala University, and is currently trying to get employeed, which seems as 
	far more of a challenge today than it was when I finished my education in 1987.</p>
	
	
	
	
	<h3> Work experience </h3>
	
	<p>
	I have worked in several companies with very different tasks.
	My career started in 1987 with research around signal processing and transform methods for the Swedish military.  </p>
	
	<p>
	In 1991 I joined Ericsson, to which I have come back several times, as it is one of the bigger employers in Stockholm, 
	especially if you have a background in telecoms. My first role was to travel to Ericsson's customers across the world, 
	teaching them about mobile telephony in general, and Ericsson's systems in particular. GSM was introduced in Sweden in 1991 
	and it was a very interesting time in the early 90's with the introduction of mobile telephony on a broader scale across the globe. 
	I traveled to Australia, US, Singapore and all across Europe with my slide deck (very heavy) and course books (and no laptop or mobile phone). </p>
	
	<p>	
	I then moved on to more sales related tasks such as building business case models for simulation of revenues and costs related to introduction of 3G, 
	all in order to prepare Ericsson's customers when building their analyses on what to pay for the 3G licenses, primarily in Europe. 	</p>
	
	<p>
	Then the dotcom bubble burst and also Ericsson had issues, but before that I had, luckily, moved to a new position, working with an operator and their 
	3G introduction in Sweden. This was the first time I came in contact with proucurement, which since then has become by main work area. </p>
	
	<p>
	After a few tough years in the telecom industry during the early 2000, I rejoined Ericsson in 2007, focusing only on procurement, or sourcing as we call 
	it in Ericsson. I first worked five years with IT sourcing, where my main task was to re-negotiate the outsourcing agreement of IT infrastructure 
	(laptops, servers, storage) for Ericsson's 100 000 employees. Thereafter I joined the Hardware Sourcing unit where I am currently employeed, 
	where we source all components needed to manufacture Ericsson's products (primarily radio and baseband units). My current category is PCBs
	(printed circuit boards), where all our suppliers are based either in China or in Taiwan. Naturally this means a lot of international contacts, even 
	though the level of travel has decreased significantly after Covid-19 and the economic downturn.</p>

	<h2> Academic Interests </h2>
  
  	<p>
	I enjoy learning new things, primarily languages or computer science. After learning about Antagning.se some 20 years ago I have taken a lot of courses
	at almost all different universities in Sweden. </p>

	<h2> Future goals </h2>
	<p>
	As I just recently turned 60, I have no specific future career plans. My husband took an early retirement package last year, and seems to enjoy 
	life, taking university courses, exercising every day (Vasaloppet is on the bucket list) and spending time around the house.
	I can imagine doing that as well in a few year's time.
	</p>

				<h3> Travel plans </h3>
				<p>
				I did the Camino Portugues, walking 250 km from Porto in Portugal to Santiago de Compostela in Spain last spring, and enjoyed it a lot.
				On my bucket list is therefore doing the entire Camino Frances, starting in Saint Jean Pied de Port in southern France, and walking 800 km 
				to Santiago de Compostela. I enjoy the freedom of walking, not bothering about anything than where I am going to sleep next night, and what
				I should eat for dinner.
				</p>
				<p>
				I would also like to travel to Japan. I was supposed to go there in March 2011, but due to the Fukushima incident, my travel plans to Tokyo was cancelled.
				I have promised my daughter to go with her, once she finishes her batchelor thesis in computer linguistics, unfortunately it seems not to happen in the near future.
				</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column2">

				<h3> Learning </h3>
				<p>
				I wish to continue to take courses, but will most likely shift focus from computer science to history or politics. I want to learn more
				about the world as it looks today, and also the history of it, such as the industrial revolution or the migration flows across the globe. 
				This semester I will start with one course in history, and I shall see where that will take me. I also want to study a bit of litterature history,
				more in order to be educated than for a real need.

				</p>
				I also wish to have more time to read books. I try to read some every day, borrowing books at the library (reading on my Kindle), but sometimes
				time is limited, and I don't manage as much as I want. There are so many good books to read. I log all my readings on Goodreads.com to keep 
				track of it, and I like to be able to give recommendations to friends about good books.
